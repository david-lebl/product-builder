## 6. Compatibility Rules & Validation

### Material → Finish Rules

| Rule | Reason |
|---|---|
| Lamination only on coated stock ≥200gsm | Film won't adhere properly to thin/uncoated stock |
| Soft-touch lamination only on coated stock ≥250gsm | Needs smooth, heavier stock |
| UV coating (spot/flood) only on coated smooth surfaces | Uncoated/textured absorbs unevenly |
| Foil stamping requires smooth surface ≥200gsm | Foil won't transfer cleanly on rough/thin stock |
| Embossing/debossing requires ≥250gsm | Thin stock tears or doesn't hold impression |
| Letterpress impression requires thick soft stock ≥300gsm (cotton, uncoated) | Needs soft fiber to take deep impression |
| Thermographic finish incompatible with lamination | Heat re-activation melts laminate |
| Edge painting requires ≥400gsm | Cards must be thick enough to show painted edge |
| Aqueous coating is inline (offset only) | Applied on press, not available for digital |
| Scoring required for folding on stock ≥170gsm | Heavier stock cracks without scoring |
| Floor graphics require overlamination | Mandatory for slip resistance and durability |
| NCR stock cannot be laminated or UV coated | Destroys carbonless transfer chemistry |

### Finish → Finish Rules (Mutual Exclusion & Dependencies)

| Rule | Reason |
|---|---|
| Matte lamination ↔ gloss lamination: mutually exclusive | Cannot apply two lamination types |
| Matte lamination ↔ soft-touch lamination: mutually exclusive | Same — one lamination only |
| Gloss lamination ↔ soft-touch lamination: mutually exclusive | Same — one lamination only |
| Lamination ↔ aqueous coating: mutually exclusive | Both are full-surface treatments |
| Lamination ↔ varnish (flood): mutually exclusive | Redundant surface protection |
| Spot UV often combined with matte lamination | Matte background makes spot UV pop — valid combo |
| Spot UV requires lamination or coating base | UV doesn't adhere well to raw paper |
| Embossing + foil can combine (foil + emboss in one pass) | Common premium combination |
| Thermographic finish ↔ lamination: mutually exclusive | Heat conflicts |
| Folding requires scoring if ≥170gsm | Dependency, not exclusion |
| Binding requires minimum page count | Saddle stitch ≥8 pages, perfect ≥40 pages |

### Printing Method → Material Rules

| Rule | Reason |
|---|---|
| Offset requires ≥500 quantity to be cost-effective | Setup cost amortization |
| Letterpress limited to ≤2 colors (PMS) | Mechanical process, one plate per color |
| Screen printing limited to PMS/spot colors | Not process-color capable for detail |
| UV-curable inkjet required for rigid substrates | Ink must cure on non-absorbent surface |
| Eco-solvent/latex for vinyl and flexible substrates | Standard large-format process |
| Digital toner limited to ≤350gsm (machine feed limit) | Physical thickness limitation |
